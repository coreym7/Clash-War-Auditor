# Clash of Clans Clan Manager App

Welcome to my Clash of Clans Clan Manager App project! This application is designed from the ground up to assist Clash of Clans players, especially clan leaders, in managing their clan's activities with an emphasis on optimizing war strategies through detailed data analysis. By leveraging the Clash of Clans API, this app aims to streamline the management process by offering insightful data on wars, player performance, and clan progress, all accessible from the convenience of your mobile device.

- **Intuitive User Interface**: Provide a user-friendly interface that allows clan members to effortlessly view, filter, and analyze war data.

## Development Approach

This project adopts a mobile-first development approach using Flutter and Dart, which aligns with the goal of providing a portable and accessible tool for clan management. The choice of Flutter as the development framework ensures that the application can be easily extended to a web platform, offering flexibility in how the application is deployed and used in the future.
